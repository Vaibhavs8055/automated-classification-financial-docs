# Automated Classification of Financial Documents Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to automate the classification of merchant onboarding forms. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the classification process using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the MobileNetV2 architecture.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather and preprocess a comprehensive dataset of merchant onboarding forms.
2. **Model Development**: Utilize the MobileNetV2 architecture, fine-tuned for our specific task.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model on the dataset and evaluate its performance using various metrics.
4. **Implementation**: Deploy the model in a real-world setting and assess its impact on the onboarding process.
